      <h2>About Food</h2>
      <p>
        The origins of jollof rice can be traced to the Senegambian region that
        was ruled by the Wolof or Jolof Empire in the 14th century, spanning
        parts of today's Senegal, The Gambia and Mauritania, where rice was
        grown. The dish has its roots in a traditional dish called
        thieboudienne, containing rice, fish, shellfish and vegetables. Food and
        agriculture historian James C. McCann considers this claim plausible
        given the popularity of rice in the upper Niger valley, but considers it
        unlikely that the dish could have spread from Senegal to its current
        range since such a diffusion is not seen in "linguistic, historical or
        political patterns". Instead he proposes that the dish spread with the
        Mali empire, especially the Djula tradespeople who dispersed widely to
        the regional commercial and urban centers, taking with them economic
        arts of "blacksmithing, small-scale marketing, and rice agronomy" as
        well as the religion of Islam. Marc Dufumier, an emeritus professor of
        agronomy, proposes a more recent origin for the dish, which may only
        have appeared as a consequence of the colonial promotion of intensive
        peanut cropping in central Senegal for the French oil industry, and
        where commensurate reduction in the planted area of traditional millet
        and sorghum staples was compensated by forced imports of broken rice
        from Southeast Asia. It may then have spread throughout the region
        through the historical commercial, cultural and religious channels
        linking Senegal with Ghana, Nigeria and beyond, many of which continue
        to thrive today, such as the TijƒÅniyyah Sufi brotherhood bringing
        thousands of West African pilgrims to Senegal annually.

      <h2>Steps to prepare Jollof rice</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Blend the peppers, tomatoes, onion, ginger and garlic with 1 cup of
          water to form a smooth mixture
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Heat the oil in a pot and add the mixture, along with the stock cubes
          and seasoning. Add the remaining 2 cups of water and bring to a boil
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Add the rice to the mixture, stirring well, then lower the heat
          completely. Cook for about 30 minutes, making sure the rice doesn't
          stick to the bottom of the pot (you might have to add a tiny bit more
          water as you go along). You want all the water to be absorbed and the
          rice texture to be light and fluffy.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>Spoon the rice out onto a separate dish and serve.</li>
      </ol>
